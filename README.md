# CookMark, your interactive recipe website

The purpose of the project stems from an issue of mine. One of most loved hobbies is cooking, however I've
noticed my bookmarks of several recipe pages are starting to rile up and I end up scrolling, trying to find the recipes in the 
small bookmark text. Therefore, the purpose of this project is storing your own favorite recipes of what you've found on the
internet.

## UX

### User Stories

As a user...
Navigation and viewing:
1. I want to easily find essential functions.
2. Be able to go back to the home page.
3. View the most important parts of the recipe, so I can read more if I want to.
4. An uncluttered page, to minimize potential frustration.
5. Find contact information easily.
CRUD:
6. I want to be able to add my own recipes with almost no restrictions.
7. It would be great to sort my information according to preferences.
8. If I'm completely unhappy, I need to remove the information I've added previously.
9. I need to be able to update my recipe with notes for instance.
Interaction:
10. Visual cues are a good way to see things are working as they should.
11. Responsive design is appriciated, as I can then use my phone, tablet or desktop for the app without any "friction".

### Not implemented
* Collections, for a user to create their own collection and thereby be able to sort the recipes better.
* Sorting system, using data such as difficulty to sort the recipes from each other.
* Contact Modal

### Design

The design process was to first begin with pencil sketches, where I made the initial wireframes and
ideas for the CookMark logo. After having a rough idea of what I wanted, I made the wireframes digital in Figma.
Figma is really a great tool when working a lot with frontend. Helps to plan out the app's responsiveness.

My main goal with the website design was to make it easily manageable and practical for the user. As I want to have one, go-to place
where I can store all of my recipes there's no need for anything "too" fancy.

#### Illustrations

Logo: The CookMark logo is supposed to represent the main idea of the project, bookmark + food.
The bookmark is represented in the shape of the logo, so when it sits on the top of the page, it resembles a bookmark
hanging down from the navbar. Food comes from the inner, cut-out shape of a fork, which is also the shape of an M.
What I'm content with are the cut-out C and fork(M) in the logo, as they are the initials for CookMark.

Other illustrations: The girl on the home page is from undraw.com, which is free for non-commercial use.
