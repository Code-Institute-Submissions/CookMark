# Cook Mark, your interactive recipe website
The purpose of the project stems from an issue of mine. One of most loved hobbies is cooking, however I've
noticed my bookmarks of several recipe pages are starting to rile up and I end up scrolling, trying to find the recipes in the 
small bookmark text. Therefore, the purpose of this project is storing your own favorite recipes of what you've found on the
internet.

### User Stories

As a user...
Navigation and viewing:
1. I want to easily find essential functions.
2. Be able to go back to the home page.
3. View the most important parts of the recipe, so I can read more if I want to.
4. An uncluttered page, to minimize potential frustration.
5. Find contact information easily.
CRUD:
6. I want to be able to add my own recipes with almost no restrictions.
7. It would be great to sort my information according to preferences.
8. If I'm completely unhappy, I need to remove the information I've added previously.
9. I need to be able to update my recipe with notes for instance.
Interaction:
10. Visual cues are a good way to see things are working as they should.
11. Responsive design is appriciated, as I can then use my phone, tablet or desktop for the app without any "friction".

### Not implemented
* Collections, for a user to create their own collection and thereby be able to sort the recipes better.
